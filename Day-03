                          STATIC TESTING TECHNIQUE :
                          --------------------------

1) REVIEW : It is conduct on documents ensure correctness and completeness.
   
       * Requirement Reviews
       * Design Review
       * Code Review 
       * Test plan Review 
       * Test cases Review etc.

2) WALKTHROUGH : 
        
       * It is a informal Review (informal: without any plan).
       * Author reads the documents or code and discuss with peers.
       * Also walkthrough does not have minutes of the meet.
       * Need at least two or more people conduct the testing.

3) INSPECTION : 

       * It is most formal Review.
       * In which at least 3-8 peoples will involve 
         1) reader 2) writer 3)moderator  and concerned team.
       * inspection team have proper schedule it will intimated by via email and concerned developer/tester.


                           QA & QC & QE :
                           --------------

1) QUALITY ASSURANCE : It is a process related.
   Quality CONTROL  : It is actual testing of the software.

2) QA focuses on building the quality.
   QC focuses on testing for quality.

3) QA preventing the defects : preventing means fallow the correct process
   QC detecting defects.

4) QA process management.
   QC is product management.

5) QA fallow the entire life cycle of SDLC.
   QC fallow the testing part in SDLC.

QUALITY ENGINEERING(QE):

QE means to write the code for testing the software (Automation testers).


                      LEVELS OF TESTING :
                      -------------------

1) UNIT TESTING :
-------------------------

* Unit is a single component or module of the software.
* Unit testing conducted by single module or component.
* Unit testing is conducted by Developers.
* Unit testing is white box testing technique.
* Unit testing technique :
  
            - Basis path testing
            - Control structure testing 
            - conditional coverage
            - Loops coverage 
            - Mutation testing 

2) INTEGRATION TESTING :
---------------------------

* Integration testing performed between the two or more module.
* It is focuses on communication between the multiple modules.
* It is the white box testing technique.
* It is conduct the developer. SOMETIME Tester will conduct integration testing 
    - CODE LEVEL : Developer will conduct.
    - UI LEVEL : Tester will conduct.

    TYPES OF INTEGRATION TESTING:
    -----------------------------

* INCREMENTAL INTEGRATION TESTING :
------------------------------------
                Incrementally adding the module and testing the data flow between the module.

    APPROACHES :

    * TOP DOWN : 
            Incrementally adding the module and testing the data flow between the module. ensure that added module is the child of      previous module.

    * BOTTOM UP :
            Incrementally adding the module and testing the data flow between the module. ensure that added module is the parent of    previous module.

    * SANDWICH/HYBRID :
            Combination of both top down and bottom up approach.

* NON-INCREMENTAL INTEGRATION TESTING :
----------------------------------------
                Adding all the module at one shot and test the data flow between the module.

    DRAWBACKS:

    * We might miss the some data flow between the modules.
    * If you find any defect we can understand the root cause of defect.

3) SYSTEM TESTING :
--------------------

* Testing the overall functionality of the software with respect to client requirement, should know the customer requirement.
* It is the Black box testing technique.
* Tester will conduct.
* System testing focuses on :
        * User Interface testing(GUI)
        * Function testing.
        * N0n-Functional testing.
        * Usability testing.

4) USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING(UAT):
--------------------------------

* After completion of system testing UAT team conduct the acceptance testing in 
two level :

        * ALPHA LEVEL.
        * BETA LEVEL.
